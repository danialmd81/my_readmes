To install LaTeX on your system, you can use the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install texlive
```

This command uses `apt-get`, the package handling utility in Debian-based systems, to install `texlive`, which is a comprehensive distribution of the TeX typesetting system. The `sudo` command is used to run the installation with superuser (administrator) privileges.

```bash
sudo apt-get install texlive-xetex
sudo apt install texlive-extra-utils
sudo apt texlive-lang-all
sudo apt-get install python3-pygments
```
