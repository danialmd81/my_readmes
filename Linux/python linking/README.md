```bash
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/python3 /bin/python
```

### Explanation

This command creates a symbolic link (symlink) named `/bin/python` that points to the Python 3 interpreter located at `/usr/bin/python3`.

- `sudo`: Runs the command with superuser (root) privileges, which is necessary for modifying files in system directories like `/bin`.
- `ln -s`: Creates a symbolic link. The `-s` option specifies that the link should be symbolic.
- `/usr/bin/python3`: The target file that the symlink will point to. This is the location of the Python 3 interpreter.
- `/bin/python`: The name and location of the symlink being created.

### Why is this needed?

Some scripts and applications expect the `python` command to be available in the system's PATH. By default, this command might point to Python 2.x, which is deprecated. Creating a symlink from `python` to `python3` ensures that when `python` is called, it will use Python 3 instead.

### Important Note

Be cautious when creating symlinks in system directories, as it can affect system-wide behavior and other applications that rely on the `python` command. Ensure that no critical applications depend on Python 2.x before making this change.
