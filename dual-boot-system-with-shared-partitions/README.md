# Setting Up a Dual-Boot System with Shared Partitions

To achieve this setup, follow these steps:

## 1. Backup Your Data

Before making any changes to your partitions, ensure you have a backup of all important data.

## 2. Create a Partition Scheme

- **Windows Partition**: For Windows installation.
- **Linux Root Partitions**: Separate partitions for each Linux distribution.
- **Shared Home Partition**: A single partition to be used as the home directory for all Linux distributions.
- **Shared Data Partition**: A partition formatted with a filesystem that both Windows and Linux can read/write (e.g., NTFS).

## 3. Partition Your Disk

1. Boot from a live Linux USB or CD.
2. Use a partitioning tool like GParted to create the partitions.

## 4. Install Windows

1. Install Windows first, as it tends to overwrite the bootloader.
2. During installation, select the partition created for Windows.

## 5. Install Linux Distributions

1. Install each Linux distribution one by one.
2. During installation, select the respective root partition for each distribution.
3. Set the shared home partition as home for each distribution.
4. Ensure the bootloader is installed for each distribution.

## 6. Configure the Shared Data Partition

1. Format the shared data partition as NTFS.
2. Mount the shared data partition in both Windows and Linux.

## 7. Update fstab for Shared Home and Data Partitions

Edit the `fstab` file in each Linux distribution to mount the shared home and data partitions automatically.

Example `fstab` entries:

```markdown
# Shared Home Partition
UUID=<home-partition-uuid> /home ext4 defaults 0 2

# Shared Data Partition
UUID=<data-partition-uuid> /mnt/shared ntfs-3g defaults 0 0
```

## 8. Reboot and Test

1. Reboot your system and test that you can boot into each OS.
2. Verify that the shared home and data partitions are accessible from each OS.

By following these steps, you will have a dual-boot system with multiple Linux distributions sharing a single home partition and a shared data partition accessible from both Windows and Linux.
