To combine retry settings with timeout settings in apt, you can configure both options in the same APT configuration file. This ensures that apt not only retries a limited number of times but also enforces a timeout for each attempt. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99timeout-and-retries
```

```bash
# Set the number of retries to 1 (initial attempt + 1 retry)
Acquire::Retries "1";

# Set a 10-second timeout for HTTP and FTP sources
Acquire::http::Timeout "10";
Acquire::ftp::Timeout "10";

# Optional: Set a connection timeout (time to establish a connection)
Acquire::http::ConnectTimeout "10";
Acquire::ftp::ConnectTimeout "10";
```

Explanation of the Configuration
Retries: The Acquire::Retries option controls how many times apt retries a failed download. Setting it to "1" means apt will retry only once (total of 2 attempts: the initial attempt + 1 retry).

Timeouts:

Acquire::http::Timeout and Acquire::ftp::Timeout set the maximum time apt waits for a response from HTTP and FTP sources.

Acquire::http::ConnectTimeout and Acquire::ftp::ConnectTimeout set the maximum time apt waits to establish a connection (optional but recommended).
